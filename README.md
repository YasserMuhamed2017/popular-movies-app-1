# Popular Movies
The Popular Movies app was developed for the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Program. The app allows users to discover the most popular and the most rated movies playing. Additionally, users are able to get detailed information for every proper movie.  

# Note
This app uses The Movie Database API to retrieve movies data. You must provide your own API key in order to run the functional app. When you get it, find "MovieDBConfig.API_KEY" in the source and replace it with your own key.
